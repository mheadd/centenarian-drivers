# Centenarian Drivers in NYS

This chart shows licensed drivers in New York State with a reported birth year of 1916 or earlier. The totals for each county include only those drivers with a [class D license](https://dmv.ny.gov/driver-license/nys-driver-license-classes) that is valid with no restrictions. Only counties with more than 10 licensed drivers over 100 years of age are shown.

Possesion of a valid license is not meant to imply that these individuals operate a motor vehicle, just that they are licensed to do so.

All data is from the New York State open data portal.
